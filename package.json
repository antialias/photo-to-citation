  "description": "Photo To Citation is an experimental app that helps residents of Oak Park, IL report vehicle violations that jeopardize pedestrian and nonâ€‘motorized safety. The goal is to take an uploaded photo of a violation and automatically produce a report that can be sent to the appropriate civil authorities. The system attempts to track each report until it becomes an official citation, even when that involves manual steps like mailing forms or payments.",
