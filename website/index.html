  <h1>Photo To Citation</h1>
  <p>Stop dodging cars in the bike lane or on the sidewalk—let one photo clear the path.</p>
</div>
<p>Welcome to <strong>Photo To Citation</strong>, a tool for cyclists and pedestrians who feel powerless when vehicles clog their space. If your city needs help keeping streets usable for bikes and walkers, just grab your phone, snap a photo and keep moving. We handle the paperwork while the citation heads to the authorities. This isn’t for drivers—it’s for everyone who relies on safe alternatives to cars.</p>
