Photo To Citation automates the tedious parts of reporting parking violations.

- **Create cases from photos or inbound email** — upload images or forward them directly to your dedicated address.
- **Automatic AI analysis** — a language model extracts vehicle details, location clues and violation type.
- **Reverse geocoding** — GPS data from photos is converted into street addresses.
- **Generate reports** — the app assembles everything into a clear PDF or email for the authorities.
- **Multi-channel notifications** — send updates via email, SMS or even snail mail.
- **Citation tracking** — built-in modules keep tabs on the status of each citation.
