- **Automatic AI analysis** — language models pull out license plates, location clues and violation type.
- **Reverse geocoding** — GPS data from your photos instantly turns into street addresses.
- **Generate reports** — the app assembles everything into a clear PDF or email for the authorities.
- **Multi-channel notifications** — get updates via email, SMS or even snail mail.
- **Citation tracking** — built-in modules keep tabs on the status of each citation so you know it’s moving forward.
