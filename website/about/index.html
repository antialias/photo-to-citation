      <h1>About Photo To Citation</h1>
<p>Photo To Citation began as a community project in Oak Park, IL. Our goal is to make it effortless for residents to document dangerous parking behavior and ensure violators are held accountable. By combining modern web tech with language models, we streamline everything from photo analysis to mailing citations.</p>
