Photo To Citation began as a community project in Oak Park, IL. Our goal is to make it effortless for residents to document dangerous parking behavior and ensure violators are held accountable. By combining modern web tech with language models, we streamline everything from photo analysis to mailing citations.

While we started with cyclists frustrated by blocked bike lanes, the app is just as useful for pedestrians detouring around cars on the sidewalk. Every screen works beautifully on a phone so you can capture, upload and continue your ride or walk. We built this for communities where the police need a little extra help keeping streets usable for alternative transportation—not for drivers complaining about other drivers.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to keep sidewalks and bike lanes clear so everyone can move freely. We believe better streets start with neighbors helping one another and a straightforward way to hold scofflaws accountable.

## Community Spirit

We champion cooperation—one quick photo can transform frustration into positive action. Each report builds a safer space for walkers, wheelchair users and cyclists.
