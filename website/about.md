# About Photo To Citation

Photo To Citation began as a community project in Oak Park, IL. Our goal is to make it effortless for residents to document dangerous parking behavior and ensure violators are held accountable. By combining modern web tech with language models, we streamline everything from photo analysis to mailing citations.

We built this especially for cyclists who face blocked bike lanes daily. Every screen works beautifully on a phone so you can capture, upload and move on with your ride.
