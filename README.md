# Photo To Citation

Photo To Citation is an experimental app that helps residents of Oak Park, IL report vehicle violations that jeopardize pedestrian and non‑motorized safety. The goal is to take an uploaded photo of a violation and automatically produce a report that can be sent to the appropriate civil authorities. The system attempts to track each report until it becomes an official citation, even when that involves manual steps like mailing forms or payments.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Use [`Biome`](https://biomejs.dev/) for consistent formatting and linting:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

## OpenAI Integration

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
```

The helper in `src/lib/openai.ts` uses this key to analyze uploaded violation
photos with OpenAI's vision model. It sends the image to the model and requests
a JSON response describing the violation. The JSON follows a schema that
includes the violation type, location clues, and vehicle details such as make,
model, color and license plate information.

When a user uploads a photo, the API stores the case immediately and then
triggers OpenAI analysis in the background. These asynchronous tasks are
managed by [Bree](https://github.com/breejs/bree), which spawns worker threads
to handle image analysis and reverse geocoding. The resulting JSON is persisted
alongside the case record once the analysis completes, so uploads are never
blocked waiting for OpenAI.

If the uploaded image contains GPS EXIF data, the latitude and longitude are
extracted and saved with the case information.

If a `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is provided in `.env`, the app also performs a
reverse geocode lookup for each case in the background. The resulting street
address and closest intersection are stored with the case once the lookup
completes.
